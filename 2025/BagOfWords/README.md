There is some code with my stemming and bug of words model
It was used in my telegram bot for channel. I had pairs "question => reply". For each new message bot was comparing it with questions and if it were similar enough he answered. For example, "Hello" => "Hi there!"

Implementation is quite fast and efficient. Bot worked on my Raspberry Pi 4 and answered for about 40 milliseconds for several thousands of questions
